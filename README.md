# Food-Peek

<p>How often do we not struggle to decide on what to cook for dinner? Or see some mouthwatering dishes on the television/ internet but don’t know what it’s called? Or that
situation we experience when we see something delicious and exciting on the adjacent
table? Or unable to find the local name for a food item in a foreign country/ foreign
language? </p>

<p>Food Peek helps you tackle such exact situations.
Food Peek makes use of efficient machine learning algorithms to successfully classify the
image input by the user and output the name, ingredients, recipes, nutrition content and
sites from where the item can be ordered.</p>
